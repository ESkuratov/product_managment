A culture of Freedom and Responsibility

Your number one goal as a leader is to develop a work environment consisting exclusively of stunning colleagues.

**Build up talent density**
- Jerks, slackers, sweet people with nonstellar performance or pessimists left on the team will bring down the performance of everyone.
- don't need the rules and can eliminate most controls
- made up of high performers
  - employees  learn more from one another and teams  accomplish more faster.
  - Stunning colleagues accomplish significant amounts of important work and are exceptionally creative and passionate.
- motivated 

**Increase candor**
-  feedback necessary to take performance to another level
-  When giving and receiving feedback is common, people learn faster and are more effective at work. 
-  Feedback helps us to avoid misunderstandings, creates a climate of co-accountability, and reduces the need for hierarchy and rules.
-  Set the stage for candor by building feedback moments into your regular meetings
-  Coach your employees to give and receive feedback effectively, following the 4A guidelines.
-  **4A FEEDBACK GUIDELINES**
   -  **Giving Feedback**
      -  AIM TO ASSIST: Feedback must be given with positive intent
      -  ACTIONABLE: Your feedback must focus on what the recipient can do differently
   - **Receiving Feedback**
     - APPRECIATE: When you receive feedback, you need to fight this natural reaction and instead ask yourself, “How can I show appreciation for this feedback by listening carefully, considering the message with an open mind, and becoming neither defensive nor angry?
     - ACCEPT OR DISCARD: The provider must understand that the decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient.
  

**Reduce controls**
- Remove Vacation policies
  - removed vacation tracking and day off
  - Unlimited vacation helps attract and retain top talent
  - Reduces bureaucracy and the administrative costs of keeping track of who is out and when.
  - Leadership team to do the same
  - Only one team member can be out at a time
  - you’re not causing the rest of the group undue grief before booking your vacation.

- Remove Travel policies
- Remove Expense policies 
  - Expense guideline
    - act in netflix's best interest
    - context at the front end
  - When removing travel and expense policies, encourage managers to set context about how to spend money up front and to check employee receipts at the back end. If people overspend, set more context.
  - With no expense controls, you’ll need your finance department to audit a portion of receipts annually
  - When you find people abusing the system, fire them and speak about the abuse openly—even when they are star performers in other ways. This is necessary so that others understand the ramifications of behaving irresponsibly.
  - Some expenses may increase with freedom. But the costs from overspending are not nearly as high as the gains that freedom provides.
  - With expense freedom, employees will be able to make quick decisions to spend money in ways that help the business.
  - Without the time and administrative costs associated with purchase orders and procurement processes, you will waste fewer resources.
  - Many employees will respond to their new freedom by spending less than they would in a system with rules. When you tell people you trust them, they will show you how trustworthy they are.
