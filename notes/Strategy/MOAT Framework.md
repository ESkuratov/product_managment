# MOAT Framework



MOAT stands for:

M — Market Strategy: Is your go-to-market strategy dominant, disruptive, or differentiated?

O — Ocean conditions: Are you in a red- or blue-ocean business?

A — Acquisition: Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing strategy?

T — Time-to-value: How fast can you showcase value?



## Market Strategy


These growth strategies can be visualized in a matrix based on two different variables:

1. **Does your product get the job done better or worse than others?** You might have a product that solves a problem better than anything else out there, thereby winning an underserved portion of the market. You might have a product that solves just one part of a problem really really well, which would allow you to capture an over-served market.

2. **Do you charge more or less than others?** Pretty self-explanatory. Price plays a big role in how you grow and win customers. You might cost more and be a premium option, or you might cost less and be a budgetwise choice.

**Dominant strategy** — Win all types of customers (gets job done better, charge more)

**Disruptive strategy** — Win overserved customers (gets job done worse, charge less)

**Differentiated strategy** — Win underserved customers (gets job done better, charge less)

**Out of business** — In due time (gets job done worse / charge more)
