HI 
My name is Evgeniy
I am from Moscow
Nowadays I work as head product owner in a marketplace of insurance products.

And when I came to this work the marketplace had only one core product. This is insurance for travel for all world.
And at the beginning of 2020, we launched two new products.
The first is insurance for auto and the second insurance for a mortgage.

Of course, you know that 2020 is a bad year for travel everything.
And new products grew up very slowly.
And I haven't known what to do. Because we have not had enough money to attract clients.
And I want to look for another way to grow new products.
